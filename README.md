"A New Traceable One-time Address Scheme Secure Against Privilege Escalation Attack"
This repository contains the implementation code for my Master's thesis:
"A New Traceable One-time Address Scheme Secure Against Privilege Escalation Attack."

📁 Folder Structure
Traceable_One-time_Address_Scheme/schemes/
Contains the original C code for my proposed scheme, as well as implementations of related schemes used for comparison.

demo/
A Python Flask-based frontend (currently under construction).
The goal is to enable users to call the algorithms from each scheme via a web interface, visualize their outputs, and measure execution time directly in the browser.

🛠️ Development Status
✅ Project structure has been set up

✅ Address generation (AddrGen) for my scheme is completed

🔧 Other functionalities are in progress and will be added soo
